    <h1>This site is under construction.</h1>
    <p>This website aims to replace <a href="https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-kit/wiki/Known-ILP-Nodes">https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-kit/wiki/Known-ILP-Nodes</a>.</p>
    <p>We have plans for adding uptime statistics, but for now, it just gives a simple list of known ILP nodes. Diagnostics like 'Ping' are periodically updated by
    <a href="https://github.com/interledger/connector.land">a script</a>.</p>

    <p>To make your connector score well on connector.land, try to set low fees, high ledger scale, peer with all the other connectors, and ask them to peer with you.
      It will probably also help for your connector to have accounts (preferably funded ones) on other ledgers, instead of just on your own local ledger.</p>

    <p>Take into account that most connectors on connector.land are running software that still changes often, and most maintainers will take their connector and/or
      ledger into (extended) maintenance mode without warning and probably without refunds, so it's probably wise to avoid putting more money onto
      any connectors than you are willing to lose.</p>

    <h2>Known ILP nodes</h2>
    <p>This is a list of known nodes as submitted by the people running them. For now, a node is assumed to run a connector as well as a ledger, in the way <a href="https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-kit">ilp-kit</a> does.
      You can add your ILP node by <a href="https://github.com/interledger/connector.land/edit/master/data/hosts.js">opening a pull request</a>.</p>
